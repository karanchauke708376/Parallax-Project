<h2 class="SecHeading">Aventure Time!</h2>
<p class="text"> Adventure is essential in life for several reasons. It brings so many positive changes in your own self and your life, letting you see your own life from a new perspective, never experienced before. Today, with such big money involved, it has also become a matter of bread and butter for many families linked with the industry.
<br><br>
The Himalayas is certainly a part of this adventurous journey, but you also have its meandering rivers, gorges, valleys, deserts, and more. Seeking spiritual bliss in India is a common practice for travellers since a long time, but if you are curious, you might want to try out its adventurous spirit too.

<p class="text">
    At Escape Adventures, it’s no secret, we love mountain biking. You can’t blame us for wanting to try more trails and new destinations. When we come across something so good, we just have to share it. Mountain biking provides a unique and exciting way to experience the outdoors.
<br><br>
     This adventure requires a good deal of physical stamina and endurance. It is a sport that involves bike riding usually off the road, mostly over challenging and rough terrain. Though, sometimes risky, the sport teaches one to trust his own skills and be self-reliable. It teaches a bike rider new skills like doing minor repairs and also to help others in eventuality.
<br> <br>
Our Mountain Bike Tours are designed to accommodate riders from a variety of backgrounds. Some tours are intended specifically for more experienced riders, while many are suitable for those with little or no mountain biking experience.

India's most well-known surf spot is likely to be Kovalam Beach in Kerala. Although it doesn't have the best surf, it's a hot tourist destination with plenty of hotels and places to hang out. And, the waves around Lighthouse Point are decent enough most of the time. They break both left and right.
